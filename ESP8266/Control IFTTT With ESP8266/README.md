This is a way to activate your IFTTT scripts by touching a GPIO pin to Grounf

To use this you need IFTTT pro so you can use webhooks

To get your event key, on IFTTT click on your webhooks applet then you should see your webhook url. YOu can copy that url then paste it somewhere and the everthing after the "/with/key/" is you key and its the same for every webhook

Your event name is what you set while setting up your webhook
