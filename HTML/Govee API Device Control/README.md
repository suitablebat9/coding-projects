It might not work in Github so open a new tab then open the console. Once you do that you should see something like this {data: {â€¦}, message: 'Success', code: 200} after you see that click the arrow to the left of it then again on the data and devices. Now you should see you device IDs and Models

    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
